# Knight’s Tour Solver

This project is a Python program that solves the classic Knight’s Tour problem on a standard 8x8 chessboard. The Knight’s Tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once.

The solution uses a backtracking algorithm combined with Warnsdorff’s heuristic — a strategy that chooses the next move with the fewest onward moves, which helps find a solution more efficiently.

## Features

- Interactive input for the starting position of the knight
- Board visualization showing the sequence of moves
- Efficient backtracking with heuristic optimization
- Error handling for invalid inputs

This project demonstrates algorithmic thinking, recursion, heuristic optimization, and Python programming skills. It can be a great addition to portfolios when applying for roles requiring problem-solving and coding expertise.
